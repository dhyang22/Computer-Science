TUPLES

* The tuple object is roughly like a list that cannot be changed— i.e tuples are sequences, like lists, but they are
  immutable, like strings. 
* Functionally, they’re used to represent fixed collections of items: the components of a specific calendar date, for instance. 
* Syntactically, they are normally coded in parentheses instead of square brackets, and 
* They support arbitrary types, arbitrary nesting, and the usual sequence operations.
