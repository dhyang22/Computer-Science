LISTS
------
* They are positionally ordered collections of arbitrarily typed objects, 
* They have no fixed size.
* They are also mutableâ€”unlike strings, lists can be modified in place by assignment to
  offsets as well as a variety of list method calls.
  
Because they are sequences, lists support all the sequence operations like strings; 
the only difference is that the results are usually lists instead of strings. For
instance, given a three-item list:

>>> L = [123, 'spam', 1.23]   # A list of three different-type objects
>>> len(L)                    # Number of items in the list
3

we can index, slice, and so on, just as for strings:
>>> L[0]                      # Indexing by position
123
>>> L[:-1]                    # Slicing a list returns a new list
[123, 'spam']
>>> L + [4, 5, 6]             # Concat/repeat make new lists too
[123,'spam', 1.23, 4, 5, 6]
>>> L * 2
[123, 'spam', 1.23, 123, 'spam', 1.23]
>>> L
[123, 'spam', 1.23]           # We're not changing the original list

Note:
-----
The list we just looked at,
1. contains three objects of completely different types (an integer, a string,
and a floating-point number). 
2. Lists have no fixed size, which means they can grow and shrink on demand, in response to list-specific operations.

>>> L.append('spam')
>>> L
[123, 1.23, 'NI', 1345, 'spam']

SORT
----
>>> L.sort()
>>> L
[1.23, 123, 1345, 'NI', 'spam']
>>>

REVERSE
-------
>>> L.reverse()
>>> L
['spam', 'NI', 1345, 123, 1.23]
