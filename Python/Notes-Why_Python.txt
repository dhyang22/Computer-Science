Why use Python?
---------------
a)  Software Quality
    * Python’s focus on readability, coherence, and software quality.
    * Python code is designed to be readable, and hence reusable and maintainable much more so than traditional
      scripting languages. 
    * Python has deep support for more advanced software reuse mechanisms such as object-oriented (OO) and 
      function programming.
b) Developer productivity
    * Python boosts developer productivity many times beyond compiled or statically
      typed languages such as C, C++, and Java. 
    * Python code is typically one-third to one-fifth the size of equivalent C++ or Java code. This means there is 
      less to type, less to debug, and less to maintain after the fact. 
    * Python programs also run immediately, without the lengthy compile and link steps required by some other tools,
      further boosting programmer speed.
c)  Program portability
    * Most Python programs run unchanged on all major computer platforms. Porting
      Python code between Linux and Windows, for example, is usually just a matter of
      copying a script’s code between machines. 
d)  Support libraries
    Python comes with a large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality, known
    as the standard library. This library supports an array of application-level pro-
    gramming tasks, from 
        #   text pattern matching to network scripting. 
    In addition, Python can be extended with both homegrown libraries and a vast collection of
    third-party application support software.
e)  Component integration - Product customization and extension tool    
    * Python code can : 
      @ invoke C and C++ libraries, 
      @ can be called from C and C++ programs, 
      @ can integrate with Java and .NET components, 
      @ can communicate over frameworks such as COM and Silverlight, 
      @ can interface with devices over serial ports, and 
      @ can interact over networks with interfaces like SOAP, XML-RPC, and CORBA
f) Enjoyment
    * Python’s ease of use and built-in toolset.
